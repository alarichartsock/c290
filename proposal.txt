I'll be making myself a new resume site that aggregates my school work and professional work into a modern looking website. It will use modern components, but not bootstrap because in my opinion those frameworks are overused. It'll have a navigation bar or drawer with different unordered lists featuring all of my posted schoolwork and github projects. It'll probably have a white theme, and I may add some JS processing to make it pop but I'm not sure if I will have time for it.
