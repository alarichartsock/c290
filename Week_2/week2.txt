	Javascript features

Javascript is a dynamically typed language. That means that it doesn't check for errors within the code before it's run, it will fail at runtime if there is an error. This allows flexibility because objects can change their types.

There are no explicit types within Javascript, Javacript only care about functionality.

Javascript is also an interpreted language. This means that Javascript is read by the computer on the fly. 

	Javascript types

	Number
