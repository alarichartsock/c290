	Web Architecture

The client is your browser and the server is some computer that has data the client wants. However, clients are not always browsers and servers can request data from each other.

A "client side" interaction is one where things are changing on the client machine. 

The server can be a multitude of different things. It's usually a computer in a data center, but you could host a website on your own machine and that could be considered a server. Additionally, you can use your own computers file system as a server. When things are server side they have access to all data on a server. 

When a server makes a change the client usually has to refresh the page for it to be updated.

	Web Languages

HTML is used to implement raw, unstyled text
CSS is used to style HTML	
Javascript is used for client side interactivity 
There are *many* server side languages

	HTTP and TCP/IP

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol.

Some key components in HTTP is the request and response. A request is composed of a header and a body. 

Example request 

POST /about HTTP/1.1
Host: main.oregonstate.edu
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 128
Cache-Control: max-age=0

The first line
    This specifies the request type (often a GET or a POST), the resource being requested (in this case the /about page) and the version of HTTP being used.
Host
    This is who the client is sending the request to.
Accept
    This is the type of file the client is OK getting back from the server. They are listed in order of preference. So here it is saying it wants a text file containing HTML. If it can't have that application specific xhtml and xml is OK and so on. Until it hits */* which means any file will work. There are a TON on content types that can be listed here.
Cookie
    This is information, stored on the client that is sent to the server with every request. It can be used to keep track of which client is which when several clients are interacting with a server. It is important to know that browsers are sending this with pretty much every HTTP request.
Referer
    This is the page the client came from. It can be occasionally useful for things like analytics but it can be fooled so it is not good to rely on it for important tasks. Referer is the actual spelling in this context. 

Example response

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.45
X-Drupal-Cache: MISS
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Content-Language: en
Location: http://main.oregonstate.edu/search/osu/foobar/0/3/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 18
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Date: Tue, 08 Sep 2015 23:58:05 GMT
X-Varnish: 305863683
Age: 0
Via: 1.1 varnish
Connection: close
X-Varnish-Cache: MISS

The First Line
    The first line of the response has probably the most important piece of information. The HTTP status code. In this case 302 (which Drupal misuses so signify that a redirect happened). You can read about the various codes in the Wikipedia entry on HTTP status codes. Generally speaking values strictly less than 400 are OK and values of 400 or greater are a problem.
Location
    This is where you actually end up after the server does its thing. In this case the address that shows up in the address bar is not the same one the link pointed to when we did the search. The server generated a page and sent us there after we ran the search. This is basically the sign post that lets the browser know what to display in the address bar.
Content-Type
    This lets the browser know what kind of data was sent back. This is how the browser knows if it should try to parse HTML, just display plain text or render an image.
Content-Length
    This is how much data was sent back in the response body. At times this can be tremendously helpful with debugging. Sometimes weird bugs will crop up and it is because hidden characters that the browser can't display get sent back. You can use this to compare how much data you expected to get sent back with how much was actually sent back.

	Git and version control

Master: The main branch of the repository.
Branch: A slightly different version of master.
Commit: A snapshot of changes you've made to the source code
Merge: The process of taking  a branch and applying the changes to the thing it branched off of.
Clone: Making a copy of a repository. 
Push: When you send your changes to the cloud
Pull-Request: A request to add a feature to a repository.

	HTML and CSS
	
	Common HTML tags

Headers (h1-h6)
Div <div></div> is used to divide content. 
Section <section></section> is used to make a thematic grouping of content. Only use when the content is related
The anchor <a href="link">A link to foo</a> links between pages
The image tag <img src="link" alt="A cute foo"> The src attribute indicates where the image is located, which can either be a web link or a relative path within the file structure
Strong, b em, i.. : This family of elements is for adding meaning or style to text within a paragraph. This is different from the previous elements which generally served to group text
	Strong <strong></strong> marks text that is more important
	b <b></b> makes text look different from different texts. It could be used to highlight keywords
	Em Emphasizes a word, often making it italic.
Lists and tables: 
	Unordered list: <ul></ul>
	Ordered list: <ol></ol>
	Use <li></li> as list items within these to populate
	<dl></dl> is a definitions list
	Use tables by starting with <table></table> and adding <tr></tr> inside. Add <th></th> inside of tr to complete with headers, or <td></td> for regular data
	
	HTML forms

Forms can be made using the <form></form> tag. The action attributes where the form will be sent while the method attribute specifies how it will be sent. 

The get request sends the key value pairs as part of the url. 

http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=url+encode&s=c73b9c0b-7565-454e-8a7e-45f4877fc0cb

Lets break this down piece by piece http: is the protocol. It tells us this is using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. Often times you will see https: which is the secure version of the protocol. Next is //stackoverflow.com. This is the address of the server we are trying to contact. After that will come the path to the resource we are requesting. In this case we are only one directory deep in /search and the server is able to interpret that as a resource. Other times you will see a directory chain ending in a file like /foo/bar/kitten.jpeg. Now what comes next is how we can tell this is probably a GET request. The ? indicates that it is the start of a query string. In that query string there is going to be a specific format for key value pairs. That format is key1=value1&key2=value2&keyn=valuen. So keys are assigned values using = and key value pairs are separated using & symbols. So in this instance the q key has the value url+encode and the s key has the value c73b.... In this case "q" probably stands for query and "s" for session but there is no real convention here.

The post request sends the same things but instead as part of the request body. Tht means that you canot tell what data was sent to a server via a post request by just looking at the URL. it will arrive at the server as part of a query string in the same format as a get query string.
